Prometheus-Autonomous drone open source project

Prometheus , in Greek mythology, is one of the most intelligent gods. I hope this project can bring unlimited wisdom and light to the research and development of drones.
Project overview

Prometheus is an open source autonomous drone software platform that provides a complete solution for the intelligent and autonomous flight of drones . This project is based on the PX4 open source flight control firmware, which aims to provide PX4 developers with mature and available on -board computer-side programs and provide a more concise and faster development experience. At present , modules such as mapping , positioning , planning , control and target detection have been integrated , and the Gazebo simulation test code is provided.

    Installation and use: Prometheus Developer Manual
